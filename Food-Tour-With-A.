 <p style="text-align:center; font-size:125%">From here on, we embark on a world-wide journey of exploring the various foods from different places and cultures.
 We will start from Africa - a culture-filled continent and then end the amazing journey in Australia- a place famous for its kangaroos and koalas.     
    Along the way, we will learn about a lot of misconceptions that people have about different cultures and most importantly - HAVE FUN! What is a tour if you don't have fun?
    Prepare yourself to see the appealing, the weird and the weirdest!</p>
